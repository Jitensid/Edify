# Edify

### INTRODUCTION  
Edify is a platform for creators and learners. Anyone can sign up and view courses on a wide range of topics for free.  

They can also upload their own content for others to watch. If a creator gets enough views/likes on his content, he gets a certificate from the application acknowledging his credibility, which shows on his profile.  

After passing a threshold, he can also apply for government schemes to fund his content creation, thus helping him, and the platform, grow.
